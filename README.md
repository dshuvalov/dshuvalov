### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”Ž My bio:

I have 7+ years of software development experience in JavaScript (React, Typescript, Flow, Node.js) and over 1 year as TechLead/TeamLead. 

My core competence includes system designing, architecting, and developing web apps with React, Typescript, Next.js, mobile apps with React Native, enterprise-level microservices with NestJS and cloud services, and applying best practices of object-oriented programming, event-driven architecture, testing, and code quality. 
I also contribute to the technical documentation, mentorship of new developers or providing support for existing ones, and designing new features and architectures. I am obsessed with CI/CD and CI tools that automate boring routines for engineers.
