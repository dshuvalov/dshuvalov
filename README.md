### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”Ž I am looking for a job in fastly growth company with strong engineering standards.

I have 6+ years of software development experience in JavaScript (React, Typescript, Flow, Node.js) and over 1 year as TechLead/TeamLead. 

My core competence includes system designing, architecting, and developing web apps with React, Typescript, Next.js, mobile apps with React Native, enterprise-level microservices with NestJS and cloud services, and applying best practices of object-oriented programming, event-driven architecture, testing, and code quality. I also contribute to the technical documentation, mentorship of new developers or providing support for existing ones, and designing new features and architectures. I am obsessed with CI/CD and CI tools that automate boring routines for engineers. 

I have been working in Dialect (YC S20) for 11 months as a contractor Senior Fullstack Engineer. I worked in a distributed engineering team as an autonomy developer. So, I know how to work fully remotely, give the right estimations and finish tasks on time.

I am looking for a job in a growth company with strong engineering standards.

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you regarding my candidacy.
